# Habit Tracker

Welcome to the Habit Tracker application! This simple yet effective tool allows you to add and track multiple habits on a daily basis. Whether it's reading a book, going to the gym, or any other habit you want to develop, this app will help you stay accountable and motivated in your journey towards building positive routines.

## Features

1. **Add Multiple Habits:** You can add and manage multiple habits that you want to track. Whether it's one or many, the app will handle them all.

2. **Track Daily Progress:** The core functionality of this app is to track your habits every day. There are three statuses for each habit:

   - **Fullfilled:** Mark the habit as done for a day.
   - **Unfullfiller:** Mark the habit as not done for a day.
   - **Skipped:** User did not take any action on a habit for a day.

3. **Seven-Day View:** The app provides a clear view of each habit for the past seven days. It displays:

   - **Today:** You can mark today's habit status.
   - **Previous Six Days:** You can see the status of the habit for each of the previous six days.

4. **Easy Status Toggle:** You can easily switch between the three statuses (fullfilled, Unfullfilled, Skipped) of a habit. You have the flexibility to change today's status as well as the status of any of the previous days.

## How to Use

1. **Add Habits:** Start by adding your habits to the tracker. Click on the "Add Habit" button and enter the habit's name.

2. **Track Daily Progress:** For each habit, you can click on the corresponding status button for each day. The buttons will toggle between "Fullfiller," "Unfullfilled," and "Skipped".

3. **Seven-Day View:** To view the past seven days' progress for a specific habit, simply click on view details.

4. **Modify Habit Status:** If you need to change the status of a habit for any of the past days, click on the corresponding status button on that day in the seven-day view.
